Reference Huffman coding
========================

This project is a clear implementation of Huffman coding, suitable as a reference for
educational purposes. It is provided separately in Java and Python, and is open source.

The code can be used for study, and as a solid basis for modification and extension.
Consequently, the codebase optimizes for readability and avoids fancy logic,
and does not target the best speed/memory/performance.

*The code herein is significantly similar to that of the original Huffman coding. It has been modified to work with the Criticality analyser
